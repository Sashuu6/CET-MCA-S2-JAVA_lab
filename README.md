# CET-MCA-S2-JAVA_lab
This repository contains the programs I developed during my 2nd semester in JAVA language. This lab has two cycles + 2 test cycles.

## Cycle-1

1. Design a class to represent a bank account, the bank maintains two kinds of account for its customer; One called savings account and other current account.
2. Implement the following Arithmetic class (not the main class, a separate user defined class). Test the class using a menu driven program.
3. Build a class “Stud” with the following properties and methods. Create array of student objects and do the various functions.
4. a menu driven program.
5. Implement the following Sort class. Method bsort() will do bubble sort & read() and disp() functions are used to read and display the sorted list.
6. Create a class with method str_op() to manipulate string operations like space removal, string concatenation, reversal. Use function overloading concept to implement each operation on your input.
7. Create a class student that stores roll no, with member function getnum and putnum. From this derive a class test with data members mark1 and mark2 and member functions getmarks and put marks. Create another class sports that stores the sports marks. Create another class result that stores total marks.
8. Creating Three-Letter String s from a Five-Letter Word: Write an application that reads a five-letter word from the user and produces every possible three-letter string that can be derived from the letters of that word. For example, the three-letter words produced from the word “bathe” include “ate,”“bat,” “bet,” “tab,” “hat,” “the” and “tea.” 

Note: To refer the complete questions, refer the cycle 1 questions from the cycle-1 folder.

## Cycle-2

1. Write   a   program   to   create  a  package  called  “stringeasy”which   has   aclass   called “stringfunctions”.It  has  the  functions -replicate(char  c,int  times),  upper(char  c),  lower (char  c),substr(String  s,int  start,int  length  ).Create  another  class  outside  this  package which uses these functions.
2. Write  a  program  to  create  apackage called “squareandcube” that  contains    two  classes Sqaure  and  Cube.  Square  class  contains  a    method  to  find  square  of  a  number and  Cube class contains a  method to find cube of a number. Create another class outside this package which uses the methods of both classes.
3. Design  java  application  to  model  Employee of an “ABC” organization.
4. Define  a  interface  EMPInterface  (void  displayEMP(),  void  giveBonus  (double  amount)). Define  an  abstract  class  Employee(empID,  fName,  lName,  salary).  Define  a  concrete  class Manager (noOfOtockOptions), subclass of Employee and define interface methods.
5. Write    a    program    that    does    the    following –trapping    NumberFormatException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  Initialize  the  array  and  read  an  array  index  from  the user. If the user has not entered a number, NumberFormatException should handle it. If the user’s input is beyond the size of the array, it should also be handled. Display the number at the index value given by the user. Display error messages accordingly.
6. Let's  say  you  are  in  business  selling  bikes  and  need  to  validate  a  customers  order.  Your program  should  throw  an  userdefined  exception  TooManyBikesException  if  the  quantity specified  by  the  user  is  more  than  150.  The  catch  block  should  allow  user  to  reenter  the value  and  get  his  order  confirmed.  Override  the  toString()  method  to  display  appropriate messages for the customer.
7. User-defined exceptions. Write a java program to create a class named account that contains the account ID and the balance, and let the user deposit to or withdraw from the account. For each transaction, a message is displayed to indicate thestatus of the transaction: successful or failed. In case of failure, the failure reason is reported. The possible failure are negative-amount-exception  (in  both  deposit  and  withdraw  transaction)  and  insufficient-amount-exception  (need  to  completed  by  you in  withdraw  transaction).    Complete  the  code  to  add insufficient-amount-exception.
8. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an  empty  method  named  printArea().  Provide  three  classes  named  Rectangle,  Triangle  and Circle  such  that  each  one  of  the  classes  extends  the  class  Shape.  Each  one  of  the  classes contain only the method printArea( ) that prints the area of the given shape.
9. Write a java program that implements a multi-thread application that has threethreads. First thread  generates  random  integer  every  1  second  and  if  the  value  is  even,  second  thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
10. Write a program using Applet to display a message.
11. Develop an Applet that receives an integer in one text field & compute its factorial value & displayit in another text filed when the button “Compute” is clicked.
12. Write a program for configuring Applets by passing parameters.
13. Draw a House using basic graphics primitives in an applet.
14. Write  a  java  program  that  simulates  a  traffic  light. The  program  lets  the  user  select  one  of three  lights:  red,  yellow,  or  green  with  radio  buttons.  On  selecting  a  button,  an  appropriate message with “stop” or “ready” or “go” should appear above the buttons in a selected color. Initially there is no message shown.
15. Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to arrange buttons for the digits and for the +, -,*, % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle    any possible exceptions like divide by zero.
16. Suppose that a table named Table.txt is stored in a text file. The first line in the file header                        and  the  remaining  lines  correspondto  row  in  the  table.  The  elements  are  separated  by   commas. Write a Java program to display the table using labels in grid layout.
17. Write a Java program that displays the number of characters, lines and words in a text file.
